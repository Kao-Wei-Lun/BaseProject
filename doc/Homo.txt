Homosexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction, or sexual behavior between members of the same sex or gender. As a sexual orientation, homosexuality is "an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions" to people of the same sex. It "also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions."[1][2]

Along with bisexuality and heterosexuality, homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the heterosexual�Vhomosexual continuum.[1] Scientists do not know what determines an individual's sexual orientation, but they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences,[3][4][5] and do not view it as a choice.[3][4][6] Although no single theory on the cause of sexual orientation has yet gained widespread support, scientists favor biologically-based theories.[3] There is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation than social ones, especially for males.[7][8][9] There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role with regard to sexual orientation.[10] While some people believe that homosexual activity is unnatural,[11] scientific research shows that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation in human sexuality and is not in and of itself a source of negative psychological effects.[1][12] There is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation.[13]
